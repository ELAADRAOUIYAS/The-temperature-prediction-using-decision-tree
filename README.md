# The-temperature-prediction-using-decision-tree
This project is a Python-based implementation of temperature prediction using decision tree algorithm. It aims to predict the temperature values based on the available features of a dataset. The decision tree algorithm used in this project is an example of supervised machine learning, which is trained using a labeled dataset.

This project demonstrates the use of decision tree algorithm for temperature prediction. It can be extended to include other features or algorithms for better accuracy.
